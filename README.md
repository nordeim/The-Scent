### Key Code Snippets

Below are representative examples that highlight how key functionalities are implemented:

#### API Route Handler Example

```typescript
// server/routes/products.ts
import { Router } from 'express';
import { getProducts, getProductById } from '../controllers/productController';

const router = Router();

router.get('/', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const products = await getProducts();
    res.json(products);
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Error fetching products' });
  }
});

router.get('/:id', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const product = await getProductById(req.params.id);
    if (!product) return res.status(404).json({ error: 'Product not found' });
    res.json(product);
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Error fetching product details' });
  }
});

export default router;
```

This snippet demonstrates how the server handles product data through RESTful endpoints while incorporating error handling.

#### React Component Example

```tsx
// client/components/ProductCard.tsx
import React from 'react';

interface ProductCardProps {
  title: string;
  price: number;
  imageUrl: string;
}

const ProductCard: React.FC<ProductCardProps> = ({ title, price, imageUrl }) => {
  return (
    <div className="max-w-sm rounded overflow-hidden shadow-lg bg-white">
      <img className="w-full" src={imageUrl} alt={title} />
      <div className="px-6 py-4">
        <div className="font-bold text-xl mb-2">{title}</div>
        <p className="text-gray-700 text-base">${price.toFixed(2)}</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default ProductCard;
```

This React component illustrates how individual product cards are rendered on the front end with attention to responsive design and aesthetics.

#### Error Handling Middleware

```typescript
// server/middleware/errorHandler.ts
import { Request, Response, NextFunction } from 'express';

const errorHandler = (err: any, req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
  console.error(err.stack);
  res.status(500).json({ error: 'An unexpected error occurred!' });
};

export default errorHandler;
```

Centralized error handling is critical to ensuring that issues are managed gracefully and do not disrupt the overall user experience.
